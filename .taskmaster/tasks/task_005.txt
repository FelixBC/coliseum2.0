# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Mock Data Services
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create service layer with simulated API responses
# Details:
Create lib/services/auth_service.dart, user_service.dart, post_service.dart, message_service.dart. Implement Future-based methods that simulate API calls with realistic delays. Use SharedPreferences for persistence. Create JSON files in assets/ for mock data. Implement error simulation for testing.

# Test Strategy:
Test all service methods return expected data structures, verify persistence works, test error scenarios
